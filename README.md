# gameoflife
Here's a video that explains the rules : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-W0NX97DB0<br>
To launch the game open a terminal and run "./bin/GameOfLife"<br>
You can chanfge the values in src/amin.cpp to use your own rules, if so don't forget to "make all" before rerunning the game<br>
This program was made with and to Linux so if you're on Windows replace the SFML libraries in _lib_ forlder by the convinient libraries which can be found here : https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ also change the Makefile commands if you're not on a UNIX-like OS<br>
Enjoy !
